# Diamond Race Leo
Leo's first attempt at a small web game in javascript 

* Single page diamond race that can be run via index.html
* Styles are found in styles.css
* Most functions can be found in the files in the modules folder
* Click on a diamond to make it move - first to 10 wins

In case no diamonds pop up - try using a live server, can't say why but that works for me
